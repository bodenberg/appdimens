# üìñ AppDimens Library Overview: The Core of Responsiveness

**AppDimens** is a unified dimension management system designed to solve a central challenge of modern UI development: **ensuring that layouts and user experiences remain consistent and visually comfortable across any screen size, ratio, or device type.**

It goes beyond the limitations of standard density-independent pixels (**Dp/Pt**), treating these values as mere starting points, which are then refined by sophisticated mathematical scaling algorithms.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Core (Dynamic + Fixed)
    implementation("io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-dynamic:1.1.0")

    // SDP & SSP scaling (optional)
    implementation("io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-sdps:1.1.0")
    implementation("io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-ssps:1.1.0")

    // All in one
    implementation("io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-all:1.1.0")
    
    // Game development (separate dependency)
    implementation("io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-games:1.1.0")
}
```

### üåê Unified Principle and Cross-Platform Compatibility

**AppDimens** is built on a platform-agnostic architecture. Its core scaling logic is identical across platforms, ensuring consistent dimension behavior wherever your code runs.

| Platform | Integration | Supported Paradigms |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| **Android** | Native. Extension libraries for **Jetpack Compose**, **XML Views**, **Data Binding**, and **Games (C++/NDK)**. | Uses dynamically adjusted `Dp`, `Sp`, and `Px`. Pre-generated SDP/SSP resources. |
| **iOS** | Native **Swift** with **SwiftUI**, **UIKit**, and **Metal** for games. CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager support. | Uses dynamically scaled `CGFloat` for `Pt` or `Px`. Game-specific viewport scaling. |
| **Flutter** | **Dart** package with extension methods for `double`. Platform-adaptive widgets for all Flutter targets. | Works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux with `fxdp()`, `dydp()`, `fxsp()`, `dysp()`. |
| **React Native** | **TypeScript/JavaScript** with React hooks. Zero native dependencies, pure JS implementation. | Platform-agnostic Fixed, Dynamic, and Fluid scaling for Android and iOS. |
| **Web** | **Framework-agnostic** core with integrations for **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **Angular**, and **Vanilla JS**. | CSS-compatible output (`px`, `rem`, `clamp()`). Media query and breakpoint support. |

### üß† The Core of the Library: Three Main Scaling Models

The power of AppDimens lies in its multiple mathematical scaling models. Developers can choose the best fit for each component, achieving responsiveness that goes far beyond simple "screen size" rules.

#### 1. Fixed (FX): Subtle and Logarithmic Scaling

* **Philosophy:** **Smooth** and **controlled** growth. The adjustment is based on the screen's **Smallest Width DP** and modulated by a **logarithmic function** that factors in the **Aspect Ratio**.
* **Highlight:** Prevents excessive growth of paddings and margins on wide tablets or 4K monitors. Ideal for preserving information density.
* **Best Use:** Paddings, margins, touch target heights (buttons, text fields), small icons, consistent typography.
* **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Web

#### 2. Dynamic (DY): Proportional and Aggressive Scaling

* **Philosophy:** **Aggressive**, **proportional** growth. The adjusted value maintains the **same percentage of the reference screen**. If an element takes up 25% of a phone screen's width, it will also take up 25% on a tablet.
* **Highlight:** Includes logic to mitigate issues in **Multi-Window (Split Screen)** mode, disabling aggressive scaling when the UI is squeezed, avoiding layout breakage.
* **Best Use:** Container widths, large elements (e.g., hero images), grids, when text size should scale with viewport size.
* **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Web

#### 3. Fluid (FL): Clamp-Based Smooth Transitions

* **Philosophy:** **Smooth interpolation** between minimum and maximum values. Uses CSS `clamp()` on Web and min-max calculations on other platforms.
* **Highlight:** Perfect for responsive typography and elements that need smooth, viewport-based transitions without breakpoints.
* **Best Use:** Typography scaling, hero text, adaptive layouts that transition smoothly across all screen sizes.
* **Platforms:** Web (primary), React Native

#### 4. SDP/SSP: Pre-Calculated Resource Scaling (Android)

* **Philosophy:** Pre-generated dimension resources for direct use in XML layouts and Data Binding.
* **Highlight:** 426+ dimension files covering all common screen configurations. Includes code package for programmatic access.
* **Best Use:** XML-based Android apps, legacy projects, when compile-time resource generation is preferred.
* **Platforms:** Android only

### ‚ö° Performance and Architecture

AppDimens is optimized for **maximum runtime efficiency**.

* **Cached Factors:** Mathematical adjustment factors (**FX** and **DY**) are calculated only once per screen configuration change (e.g., rotation). Results are cached (or remembered in Compose) and reused instantly.
* **Low Overhead:** The final dimension calculation is simply the base Dp multiplied by the precomputed adjustment factor. This results in **negligible** performance overhead during UI rendering.
* **Advantage over Static Solutions:** Eliminates the need to generate hundreds or thousands of XML resource files (`values-sw600dp/dimens.xml`), offering full flexibility for any Dp/Pt value.

### ‚ú® Highlights and Unique Features

1. **Physical Units (MM, CM, INCH):** A built-in conversion system allows you to define dimensions based on real-world measurements (e.g., $1\text{cm}$ margin), essential for precision applications (wearables, print).
2. **Advanced Qualifiers:** Supports scaling based on custom qualifiers like `WIDTH` (total width), `HEIGHT` (total height), or `SMALL_WIDTH` (smallest screen side), and can be conditioned by device type (**UI Mode Type**: TV, Car, Watch).
3. **Smart Layout Utility:** The `calculateAvailableItemCount` function calculates how many items of a defined Dp/Pt size and spacing can fit into the available container space, optimizing grid layouts dynamically.
4. **View Integration (Android):** The **`AppDimens`** object acts as a *Gateway* to the traditional View system, enabling direct conversion to Pixels (`fixedPx`, `dynamicPx`) and seamless integration through **Data Binding Adapters** in XML.

### üõë Limitations and Considerations

* **Code Dependency:** Unlike resource file‚Äìbased solutions, AppDimens requires developers to use code extensions (`.fxdp`, `.dydp`) or Gateway methods.
* **Physical Conversion Accuracy:** The accuracy of physical unit conversions (MM/INCH) depends on the reliability of the device‚Äôs reported density metadata (`xdpi`, `ydpi`).

In summary, **AppDimens** delivers a powerful and mathematically sound toolset for creating truly adaptive interfaces‚Äîregardless of device or platform.
